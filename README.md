# CM3104 Computer Security and Cryptography coursework

Python web app to digitally sign a file, and verify exising digital signatures. Developed using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for web app functionality and [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/) for cryptographic operations.

To run the app:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to that folder on your terminal
2. Run `python3 -m venv venv` to set up the virtual environment
3. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to start the virtual environment
4. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies
5. Run `python3 main.py` to start the web app
6. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) on your browser

(You may need to replace `python3` with `python` and `pip3` with `pip` depending on your Python setup)
